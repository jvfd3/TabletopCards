## Getting Started

Eruma TCG is a horror deckbuilding card game that features characters inspired by grim fables, creepy short stories and evil historical figures.
In the cursed Eruma Island you will lead a gang of outlaws and monsters to heist ancient palaces and temples and escape alive with more riches than your rivals!

## What you need to play

### Deck

Assemble your favorite cards into a Deck that follows these rules:

- The Deck must be exactly 15 Outlaw Cards.
- You can only have 1 copy of the same card in your Deck.

### Extra Deck

The Extra deck has Henchman Cards only, which are cards summoned by Outlaw cards during the game. Your Extra Deck can have as many cards as you want and no limits for copies of the same card.

### Cards

There are 2 types of cards in Eruma TCG: Outlaw and Henchman.

#### Outlaw Cards

**Artwork**: Character's picture.
**Name**: Character's name.
**Class**: Assassin, Thief, Spy or Maniac. You can see all the Class Icons below.
**Type**: Types are special card rules (aka keywords). Not all cards have a type.
**Power**: This is a special action the card can do. Every card has a unique Power.

![classes](<Imagens PDF/4 Classes.png>)

#### Henchman Cards

Henchman cards are cards summoned from your Extra Deck and they're discussed in the "How to Summon a Henchman" section.

### Game Layout

![layout](<Imagens PDF/5 Layout.png>)

Each player has their own Zone 1 and Zone 2 on their side of the Playfield with 5 positions each. They have to fight for the 5 Treasure Zone positions, where they can steal treasures.
Players cannot play cards from their hand or move cards into the opponent's zones.

## How to Play

### The Golden Rule

Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence.

### How to Win

The first player to reach a Total Treasure of 10 is the winner. When you steal a treasure, you add 1 to your Total Treasure. To steal a treasure you need a face-up card in any Treasure Zone position and take a "steal treasure" action.

### How to Start

Both players shuffle their Deck, put it face down on the table, draw 3 cards from the top of it and decide who will be the first to play.

### Turn Structure

A turn is the time frame in which a player draws a card, plays cards from their hand, makes decisions and passes if there is still no winner. It is played in this order:

1. Draw Phase
   - Draw 1 card from your Deck.
   - If the player cannot draw a card (no cards left in the Deck), the player with the most Total Treasure is the winner.
2. Planning Phase
   - Ready your exhausted cards by turning them upright.
   - Flip all your face-down cards face-up.
   - Resolve your card's skills and powers.
3. Assault Phase
   - You get 3 Action Points per turn that can be spent to play cards, move, attack, use powers, and steal treasures.
4. Rest Phase
   - If your hand has more than 6 cards, discard the excess.
   - Pass your turn.

### Action Points

Each player gets 3 Action Points per turn. Unused points do not carry over to the next turn. There are a total of 5 Actions that the player can take in any order on their turn:

- Play a card face-down from your hand into your Zone 1.
- Move one of your face-up cards.
- Attack using one of your face-up cards.
- Trigger the power of one of your face-up ready cards.
- Steal a treasure using a face-up card over any Treasure Zone position.

Skills and Types effects do not count as Actions for rules purposes.

### How to Play a Card

Spend 1 Action Point to play a card face-down from your hand into any empty position in your Zone 1.

### How to Move a Card

Spend 1 Action Point to move a face-up card to an empty adjacent position. Cards cannot move diagonally or move to your opponent's Zones.

### How to Attack Cards

Spend 1 Action Point to use a face-up card to attack an adjacent face-up card. The attacking card moves to the attacked card's position like a chess piece (attacking counts as a movement action).

The attacker kills its target and remains in the Playfield. Killed cards are sent to the Graveyard of its owner.

Cards cannot attack diagonally or attack face-down cards.

- **Assassin Skill**: An Assassin card kills any card that attacks it, unless it's another assassin. The attacking assassin has initiative and kills the attacked one.

### How to Steal a Treasure

Spend 1 Action Point to steal a treasure using one of your face-up cards over any Treasure Zone position. Add 1 treasure to your Total Treasure.

Each card can only steal a treasure once per turn.

- **Thief Skill**: All face-up thieves in Treasure Zone positions during your Planning Phase steal 1 treasure at no cost. The same thief can still take a steal treasure action at the player's Assault Phase.

### How to Use Powers

Spend 1 Action Point to trigger the power of a face-up ready card you control.

When a card's power is triggered, exhaust the card by turning it 90 degrees to the right. Follow these rules to resolve a card's power:

- An exhausted card cannot use its power until it is readied at your Planning Phase, but it can still take any other actions.
- A card must be face-up and exhausted on the Playfield to resolve its power.
- When an exhausted card is readied, flips face-down, leaves the Playfield (returns to Hand, Deck, Extra Deck or is Banished) or dies, its power wears off.
- When a card targeted by a power flips face-down, leaves the Playfield or dies before that power resolves, that card will not be hit by the power.
- Face-down cards cannot be targeted by powers.

To learn about the words Quick, Slow and Ongoing read the "Power Speed" section.

### How to Block Powers

This mechanic requires a face-down Spy card on the playfield.

- **Spy Skill**: During your opponent's turn, if they trigger the power of a card, you can flip face-up a face-down spy card to block it. That power has no effect, the action point used is lost and the card is exhausted.
This mechanic requires a face-down Spy card on the playfield.

A card exhausted by blocking is turned 90 degrees to the left. Blocking has no cost.

### Power Speed

The first word in the top of the Power box tells you when the power happens.

- **Quick**: This happens when you trigger it on your turn and it's over.
- **Slow**: This will happen on the opponent's next turn, in any phase, whenever the condition is met. When they pass their turn, it's over.
- **Ongoing**: After triggering it in your turn, this will happen whenever the condition is met, as long as the card remains face-up and exhausted on the Playfield. You can decide not to ready it at your Planning Phase and the power does not wear off.

### How to Play a Henchman

![Maníaco](<Imagens PDF/7 Maníaco.png>)

Henchman cards are different from Outlaw cards.

Henchmen do not have a Class and they are identified by the word "Henchman" and the icon above.

The text in its box is referred to as "Henchman's Effect". Once a Henchman is summoned, its effect is active as long as the card is face-up on the Playfield, and has no cost. Some Henchman have types.

- **Maniac Skill**: Only Maniacs can summon Henchman cards.

When a card's power tells you to summon a Henchman, you must take the card with the matching name from your Extra Deck and play it face-up in any empty position except the opponent's Zone 1.

Henchmen cannot move, attack, or steal treasures. Henchmen that are killed, discarded, or returned to the player's hand return to the Extra Deck."

### Banishing Cards

When a card's power tells you to banish a card, that card cannot be played again in that game. Take the card from the Playfield and put it back into its box, in your pocket, backpack or wherever you want.

### Card Types

A type is a special action a card can do as long as it is face-up on the Playfield. This action has no cost.

- **Cursed**: This card's effect is active while it is in your hand.
- **Evasive**: You can flip this card face-down in your turn.
- **Flying**: You can return this card to your hand in your turn.
- **Invulnerable**: Only "Slayer" type cards can attack or kill this card by using powers.
- **Obstacle**: Only "Strongman" type cards can attack or kill this card by using powers.
- **Regenerative**: If this card would be killed by a power, it flips face-down instead.
- **Slayer**: This card can attack or kill "Invulnerable" type cards using its power.
- **Strongman**: This card can attack or kill "Obstacle" type cards using its powers.
